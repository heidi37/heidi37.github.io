# heidifryzell.com Landing Page

<img src="./images/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of homepage on heidifryzell.com" />

## Description:

I point my domain heidifryzell.com at Github pages which renders static sites. I chose to do this so that my GitHub repos would have the address of heidifryzell.com/my-repo-name. Also GitHub doesn't charge for hosting person sites.

I built a dynamic site with Python and Flask to display my web developer portfolio. This type of site I can't host on Github pages for free but I was able to find free hosting on [render.com](render.com). You can visit my portfolio on their servers at [https://heidis-python-portfolio.onrender.com/](https://heidis-python-portfolio.onrender.com/).

I built the landing page located at [https://heidifryzell.com](heidifryzell.com) to act as my homepage and direct visitors to my portfolio, Github repos and LinkedIn profile.
