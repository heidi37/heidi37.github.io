# heidifryzell.com Landing Page

## Description:

I built the landing page located at [heidifryzell.com](https://heidifryzell.com) to act as my homepage and direct visitors to my portfolio, Github repos and LinkedIn profile. I chose to do this so that my GitHub repos would have the address of heidifryzell.com/my-repo-name. Also GitHub doesn't charge for personal hosting.

I built a dynamic site with Python and Flask to display my web developer portfolio. This type of site I can't host on Github pages for free but I was able to find free hosting on [render.com](https://render.com). You can visit my portfolio on their servers at [heidis-python-portfolio.onrender.com](https://heidis-python-portfolio.onrender.com/).
